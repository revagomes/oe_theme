Feature: Site branding
  In order to have my site branded with the official European Commission visual identity
  As a product owner
  I want to make sure that all necessary site branding features are provided by the OpenEuropa Theme.

  @javascript @enable-non-eu-language
  Scenario Outline: The European Commission logo is available throughout the site.
    Given I am on the homepage
    When the theme is configured to use the "European Union" style
    And I reload the page
    Then I should see the "logo" element in the "header"
    When I open the language switcher dialog
    And I click "<language_selector>"
    Then the "<language>" EU mobile logo should be available
    And the "<language>" header logo should contain accessibility attributes
    When the theme is configured to use the "European Commission" style
    And I reload the page
    Then I should see the "logo" element in the "header"
    And the "<language>" header logo should contain accessibility attributes
    When I am on "the user registration page"
    Then I should see the "logo" element in the "header"
    And the "English" header logo should contain accessibility attributes
